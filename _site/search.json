    "text": "I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah in 2018, where I was advised by Paul Bressloff. Before joining the faculty at Harvey Mudd, I was a CAM postdoc in the Mathematics department at UCLA (under the mentorship of Mason Porter).\nI use a combination of analytical and computational techniques to study phenomena in social and biological applications. I pair tools from dynamical systems and differential equations (including linear and weakly nonlinear analysis, perturbation theory, adiabatic reduction, and symmetric bifurcation theory), network theory, and stochastic processes with numerical simulation and data-driven computational techniques (like agent-based models and dynamic mode decomposition). Read more about my projects here.\nI am passionate about the teaching and learning of mathematics. I am a Project NExT Fellow (Silver ’19 cohort) and I was a graduate fellow for the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence at the University of Utah. I strive to create an inclusive environment where my students can engage meaningfully with challenging problems. My teaching portfolio is here.\nAs a first-generation college student and woman in mathematics, I strive to be an active advocate for historically underserved people in the math community. I am a proud member of AWM and the Spectra Ally List.\nI was born in Idaho and raised in Utah. I played classical flute for many years (I was originally a music major!). Outside of math and music, I love climbing, hiking, skiing, trivia, and coffee & tea."

The course culminates in a group project where students apply the tools of network science to an application of their choosing.\nYou can access the full lecture notes here (including Google Colaboratory links for coding exercises). This course was co-designed with Dr. Phil Chodrow at Middlebury College.\n\n\nPartial Differential Equations\nOfferings: Fall 2022, Fall 2024\nMany systems involve the evolution of quantities in space and time. We can gain great insight into such systems with mathematical models using partial differential equations (PDEs).\nPDEs are an active area of research from both applied and theoretical perspectives. We motivate our study by deriving equations based on models from physics, biology, and social systems, including:\n\ntraffic congestion\nmolecular diffusion\nheat flow\npopulation dynamics and ecology\npatterns on animal skin and seashells\n\nIn this course, we build on our foundation of multivariable calculus, differential equations, and analysis to find solutions to the resulting equations and understand their behavior and mathematical properties. We also briefly explore methods to numerically simulate a variety of PDEs on one-dimensional domains.\nTopics:\n\nFlux and conservation laws\nFirst-order PDEs, method of characteristics\nDirichlet and Neumann problems for linear second-order PDE (diffusion & heat equation, Laplace’s equation, wave equation), separation of variables\nFourier series and convergence\nWell-posedness\nMaximum principles\nGalerkin methods\nD’Alembert’s solution\nFourier transforms, the delta function, convolution, Green’s functions\nCauchy problem for the heat equation\nReaction-diffusion equations\n\n\n\nDynamical Systems\nOfferings: Spring 2024\nDynamical systems are systems that evolve over time. The presence of nonlinearities guide our approach toward qualitative rather than quantitative questions, with an emphasis on the underlying geometric behavior. In addition to being of interest in their own right, dynamical systems arise naturally as mathematical models from many disciplines including biology, chemistry, engineering, physics, and sociology.\nThis course is an introductory survey of characteristic behaviors of dynamical systems. Applications are an integral part of the course. Students engage with research in dynamical systems through an in-depth project.\nTopics:\n\nOne- and two-dimensional flows\nFixed points and linearization\nStability and phase plane analysis\nOscillations, Kuramoto model\nHomoclinic and heteroclinic orbits\nPoincare–Bendixson theorem\nBifurcation theory\nStrange attractors and chaos theory\n\n\n\nLinear Algebra\nOfferings: Spring 2021, Spring 2022, Spring 2023\nThis course is an introduction to linear algebra, which is the study of linear spaces and linear transformations. Linearity is one of the unifying themes in mathematics. Many real-world applications can be modeled or approximated by linear functions of several variables. Linear algebra is in our core curriculum at HMC. Students see connections to calculus as well as common themes that emerge in later study of differential equations.\nTopics in this course include:\n\nVector spaces\nMatrix algebra\nLinear independence\nSubspaces\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors\nSimilarity and diagonalization\nOrthogonality\nLinear transformations\nMatrix decompositions and SVD\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Mathematical Biology\nOfferings: Spring 2025\nThis is a half-semester course focusing on mathematical models of biological systems, as well as analysis and solution methods. We explore mathematical and computational approaches in biology, and build ideas that students can expand on in Math/Bio 119 (Advanced Mathematical Biology) and possibly in future research projects. The goal of this course is to explore a variety of concepts and tools that will start students on the path to becoming a fearless mathematical modeler. Students will appreciate the diverse ways that mathematics and computation are used to address questions in biology and become prepared to construct and analyze their own models. This course is team-taught with a faculty member in the biology department.\nTopics:\n\nIntroduction to mathematical modeling\nMalthusian and compensatory growth: Linear and nonlinear discrete dynamical systems\nAge-structured models: discrete-time matrix models\nContinuous population models, bifurcations, and the Allee effect\nMetapopulation models\n2-species interaction models, predator-prey dynamics\nSIR models\nComputing in MATLAB, including parameter fitting\n\n\n\nMathematics of Democracy\nOfferings: Fall 2021\nIn this course, students engage with current mathematical research to understand how mathematics illuminates, informs, and directly impacts the political system in the United States. This course has been designed to develop and strengthen skills in the following areas:\n\nReading research papers in applied mathematics,\nCritically analyzing the impacts of mathematical research on applications to the U.S. political system, and\nUnderstanding, explaining, and employing a variety of assumptions and mathematical techniques used in these applications.\n\nTopics include:\n\nElection forecasting\nVoting theory\nApportionment\nRedistricting\nStructure and parties in congress\nParty formation and political polarization\nRiots and social movements\nInformation spread\n\nCourse materials are available to instructors upon request — please contact me!\n\n\nMath Forum\nOfferings: Spring 2025\nThe goal of this course is to improve students’ comfort with and ability to communicate mathematics, both to a general and technical audience. Students present material on assigned topics and have their presentations evaluated by students and faculty. This format simultaneously exposes students to a broad range of topics from modern and classical mathematics.\nSlides: Mathematical Storytelling"
